# Differentiator

This program differentiates and expands according to Taylor the given function.

To start just type "diff" (differentiate), "diffp" (differentiate in point) or "taylor" (expand by Taylor) depending on what you want. Then type in how many times you want to differentiate and then type your function (without spaces).

Supported functions are:
```
sin
cos
tg
ctg
arcsin
arccos
arctg
arcctg
exp
abs
floor
sqrt
ln
lg
log
pow
```

The program will generate a pdf file and will show it to you. It will contain your input, the step-by-step differentiation and the final answer.
